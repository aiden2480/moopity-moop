# Moopity Moop
The repo for my bots code ðŸ˜€ See https://moopity-moop.chocolatejade42.repl.co/ for the bots website (I know, I need to get a better domain ðŸ˜’)

## Issues
Right now, the biggest issue I'm having is with the website, I can't get the bloody session to retain the data that I set. I can set it fine in the `/login` route, but it always returns empty when I try to access it wtf
PS: If this message is on GitHub, it means that I somehow managed to get past this issue and the website is working fine ðŸŽ‰ (I swore to myself that I would push changes as soon as I fixed this, not a minute before, not a minute after)

## Todo list
Stuff I have to do is unmarked, and stuff I'm slowly working on is marked.

Any comment with `TODO` in it anywhere throughout the repo is also something I have to do but I can't be bothered to put it on here lmao.

Any comment containing `FIXME` is something that I can't be bothered to fix right now but should definitely fix before I roll out the next batch of changes

`XXX` is just a glorified comment lmao. Just a flashy attention-grabber
