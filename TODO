[ ] Create better command names/aliases
[ ] Fix up the command descriptions/docs
[ ] Rip off the help command from https://github.com/nguuuquaaa/Belphegor/blob/master/belphegor/help.py because that was a cool help command
[ ] Make sure all ClientSessions are referenced as `sess` not `http` because that messes up discords internal cache

[ ] Replace All references of `Guild` with `Server` in the front-end scripts
[ ] Make an API for voting and the like?
